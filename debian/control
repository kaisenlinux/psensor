Description: display graphs for monitoring hardware temperature
 Psensor is a GTK+ application for monitoring hardware sensors,
 including temperatures and fan speeds.
 .
 It displays a curve for each sensor, alerts user using Desktop Notification
 and Application Indicator when a temperature is too high.
 .
 It can monitor:
  * the temperature of the motherboard and CPU sensors (using lm-sensors).
  * the temperature of the NVidia GPUs (using XNVCtrl).
  * the temperature of the Hard Disk Drives (using hddtemp or atasmart lib).
  * the rotation speed of the fans (using lm-sensors).
  * the sensors of a remote computer (using psensor-server).

Description: Psensor server for monitoring hardware sensors remotely
 Psensor server is an HTTP server providing a JSON Web service which can be
 used by Psensor GTK+ Application to monitor remotely the hardware sensors
 of a computer.
 .
 It can provide information about:
  * the temperature of the motherboard and CPU sensors (using lm-sensors).
  * the temperature of the NVidia GPUs (using XNVCtrl).
  * the temperature of the Hard Disk Drives (using hddtemp).
  * the rotation speed of the fans (using lm-sensors).
 .
 It is also possible to connect to Psensor server with a browser, a simple
 Web page is displaying the information.

Description: common files for Psensor and Psensor server
 It contains:
  * the languages packs,
  * the README,
  * and the FAQ.
 This package is required by psensor and psensor-server packages.
